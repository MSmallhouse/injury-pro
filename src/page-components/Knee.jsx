    "description": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. An ACL tear is a common knee injury, particularly in athletes who engage in high-demand sports like soccer, basketball, and football. This injury typically occurs when there is a sudden stop or change in direction, causing the ACL to stretch or tear. It can also result from a direct impact to the knee. Symptoms of an ACL tear include a popping noise at the time of injury, severe pain, swelling, loss of full range of motion, and a feeling of instability or 'giving way' when bearing weight. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through physical examination and imaging tests such as MRI. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the tear and the patientâ€™s activity level. Options include rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), physical therapy, and in more severe cases, surgical reconstruction of the ligament.",

    "description": "The meniscus is a C-shaped piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone). A meniscus tear is a common injury that can occur due to forceful twisting or rotation of the knee, especially while bearing weight. It's prevalent in contact sports and also in older adults due to degenerative changes in the knee. Symptoms include pain, swelling, stiffness, a catching or locking sensation in the knee, and difficulty straightening the knee fully. Diagnosis is typically through a clinical examination and confirmed by an MRI scan. Treatment varies based on the size and location of the tear, age, activity level, and overall health. It can range from conservative methods like rest, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications to surgical procedures like meniscectomy (removal of part of the meniscus) or meniscus repair.",

    "description": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome, also known as runner's knee, is characterized by pain around the patella (kneecap). It is often caused by overuse, especially in sports that involve running and jumping. This condition can also result from a misalignment of the kneecap, flat feet, or muscular imbalances. Symptoms include pain in the front of the knee, especially when sitting with bent knees, squatting, jumping, or using stairs. There's often a feeling of grinding or clicking when moving the knee. Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination, and sometimes imaging tests to rule out other conditions. Treatment focuses on pain relief and addressing the underlying causes. This may include rest, ice, physical therapy exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee, and in some cases, orthotics for foot support. Avoiding activities that aggravate the condition is also recommended during recovery.",
