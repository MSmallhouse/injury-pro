    "description": "A rotator cuff tear involves a tear in one or more of the tendons of the four rotator cuff muscles in the shoulder. These muscles and tendons stabilize the shoulder and allow for a wide range of arm movements. This injury can result from a single traumatic event or from repetitive, overhead motions. Symptoms include pain at rest and at night, particularly if lying on the affected shoulder, weakness when lifting or rotating the arm, and a crackling sensation when moving the shoulder in certain positions. There are two types of tears: a partial tear, which damages the soft tissue but does not completely sever it, and a full-thickness tear, which splits the soft tissue into two pieces. Treatment options vary based on the severity of the tear and the patientâ€™s lifestyle, ranging from physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication to surgical repair.",

    "description": "Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint. Its causes are largely unknown, but it typically develops after prolonged immobility or a minor injury. The condition tends to worsen over time and then resolves, usually within one to three years. It has three stages: the freezing stage, where pain increases gradually and the shoulder becomes less mobile; the frozen stage, where pain might diminish but the shoulder becomes stiffer; and the thawing stage, where the range of motion begins to improve. Treatment includes physical therapy, medications to reduce pain and inflammation, and sometimes corticosteroid injections. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to loosen the joint capsule.",

    "description": "Shoulder impingement syndrome occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the subacromial space, the narrow passage beneath the acromion (part of the shoulder blade). It often results from repetitive overhead activity, lifting, or other movements that cause pinching of the rotator cuff tendons. Symptoms include pain when lifting the arm, weakness, and pain when lying on the affected side. Early treatment is critical to relieve pain and prevent further damage. Treatment includes rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. In some cases, a corticosteroid injection may be given, and if conservative treatments don't work, surgery might be needed to create more space for the rotator cuff.",
