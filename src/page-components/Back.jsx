    "description": "A herniated disc, also known as a slipped or ruptured disc, occurs when the soft, jelly-like center of a spinal disc pushes through a crack in the tougher exterior casing. This herniation can irritate nearby nerves, resulting in pain, numbness, or weakness in an arm or leg. While herniated discs can occur anywhere along the spine, they are most common in the lower back (lumbar spine) and sometimes in the neck (cervical spine). Causes include age-related wear and tear, lifting heavy objects improperly, or a sudden strain or injury. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the herniation and whether the disc is pressing on a nerve. They can include arm or leg pain, numbness or tingling, and muscle weakness. Treatment for a herniated disc ranges from rest and pain medication to physical therapy and, in severe cases, surgery. Most people who follow a treatment plan experience significant relief from their symptoms.",

    "description": "Muscle strain, often referred to as a pulled muscle, is a common injury that occurs when muscle fibers are overstretched or torn. This often happens during physical activity when a muscle is fatigued, overused, or improperly used. The back muscles are particularly susceptible to strain because they are involved in a wide range of movements and activities. Symptoms of a muscle strain include pain, muscle spasms, weakness, swelling, inflammation, and limited ability to move the muscle. In severe cases, there might be a noticeable deformity or bruising. Treatment typically includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), along with over-the-counter pain relievers. Physical therapy and stretching exercises can also help heal the muscle and improve flexibility. Most muscle strains heal within a few weeks, but severe strains may take months to heal fully.",

    "description": "Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from the lower back through the hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of the body. It most commonly occurs when a herniated disc, bone spur on the spine, or narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis) compresses part of the nerve. This causes inflammation, pain, and often some numbness in the affected leg. Pain can vary widely, from a mild ache to a sharp, burning sensation or excruciating discomfort. Sometimes it can feel like a jolt or electric shock and can be worsened by prolonged sitting or sudden movements. Treatment for sciatica includes medication for pain and inflammation, physical therapy, and exercises. In severe cases, when the compressed nerve causes significant weakness, loss of bowel or bladder control, or pain that worsens or doesn't improve, surgery might be necessary. Most people recover fully from sciatica, often without the need for surgical intervention.",
