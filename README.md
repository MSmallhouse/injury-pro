# [InjuryPRO](https://msmallhouse.github.io/injury-pro/) a self-guided physical therapy website

## A prototype for a website where users diagnose their injuries and make recovery training plans just like a trained physical therapist would

This site was created as a group project for a Web Development class at Boston College. We were tasked to create a website as a human-centered solution to a problem.

### Problem
Physical injuries are a common affliciton affecting nearly everyone at some point or another in their lives. Yet, it is hard to self-diagnose injuries and design a rehabilitation plan.

### Solution
We allow users to diagnose their own injuries with in-depth descriptions of each injury and it's symptoms. From there, they can add stretching and strengthening excercises to their traning plan.

We focused on making an easy to use interface, which is especially important for our older users who face injuries at a higher rate. Our design requires minimal clicks for site navigation.
